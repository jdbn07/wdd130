                <p class="purpose-text">Rafting consists of descending a river aboard a rowing boat. The oars are used to level and direct the raft or canoe while the descent occurs, which involves various difficulties (rocks that appear on the path, turbulence produced by the current and unevenness, etc.).
                    The “descent” thing is literal: rafting usually begins at a certain height, with rivers whose channels go from the top to a lower part. This unevenness causes the boat to slide at high speed over the water, making rafting a somewhat risky activity.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="offerings-text">Watercourses present different difficulties. In some cases, the surface is almost flat, a feature that makes rafting easier. At the other extreme, there are very fast rivers, with large waves, important rocks and waterfalls: in these cases, rafting becomes a sport only for professionals.
                    In Latin America, there are a large number of rivers that are used for rafting. The Atuel River in Argentina, the Urubamba River in Peru, and the Chagres River in Panama are some of the most popular options.</p>

                <p class="evan-opinion">To find your way along the river, you have to search a little. The track was quite a challenge for a fit 36-year-old. Possible, but not easy. Especially the climb at the end killed me.</p>
